# React-Market
a fullstack, e-commerce "farmer's market" built with React, Apollo 3, and Keystone.js

This project was based on, and built alongside, Wes Bos's [Advanced React Course](https://advancedreact.com/).
While React-Market is based on this tutorial project, I've tried to add new features / make changes to make React-Market unique
